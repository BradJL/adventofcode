   <p>--- Day 3: Toboggan Trajectory ---</p>
   <p>With the toboggan login problems resolved, you set off toward the airport. While travel by toboggan might be easy, it's certainly not safe: there's very minimal steering and the area is covered in trees. You'll need to see which angles will take you near the fewest trees.</p>
   <p>Due to the local geology, trees in this area only grow on exact integer coordinates in a grid. You make a map (your puzzle input) of the open squares (.) and trees (#) you can see. For example:
    <blockquote>
    ..##.......<br>
    #...#...#..<br>
    .#....#..#.<br>
    ..#.#...#.#<br>
    .#...##..#.<br>
    ..#.##.....<br>
    .#.#.#....#<br>
    .#........#<br>
    #.##...#...<br>
    #...##....#<br>
    .#..#...#.#
    </blockquote></p>
   <p>These aren't the only trees, though; due to something you read about once involving arboreal genetics and biome stability, the same pattern repeats to the right many times:
    <blockquote>
     ..##.........##.........##.........##.........##.........##.......  ---><br>
     #...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..<br>
     .#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#.<br>
     ..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#<br>
     .#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#.<br>
     ..#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.....  ---><br>
     .#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#<br>
     .#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#<br>
     #.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...<br>
     #...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....#<br>
     .#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#  --->
    </blockquote></p>
   <p>You start on the open square (.) in the top-left corner and need to reach the bottom (below the bottom-most row on your map).</p>
   <p>The toboggan can only follow a few specific slopes (you opted for a cheaper model that prefers rational numbers); start by counting all the trees you would encounter for the slope right 3, down 1:</p>
   <p>From your starting position at the top-left, check the position that is right 3 and down 1. Then, check the position that is right 3 and down 1 from there, and so on until you go past the bottom of the map.</p>
   <p>The locations you'd check in the above example are marked here with O where there was an open square and X where there was a tree:
    <blockquote>
     ..##.........##.........##.........##.........##.........##.......  ---><br>
     #..O#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..<br>
     .#....X..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#.<br>
     ..#.#...#O#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#<br>
     .#...##..#..X...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#.<br>
     ..#.##.......#.X#.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.....  ---><br>
     .#.#.#....#.#.#.#.O..#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#<br>
     .#........#.#........X.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#<br>
     #.##...#...#.##...#...#.X#...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...<br>
     #...##....##...##....##...#X....##...##....##...##....##...##....#<br>
     .#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...X.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#  ---><br>
    </blockquote>
   </p>
   <p>In this example, traversing the map using this slope would cause you to encounter 7 trees.</p>
   <p>Starting at the top-left corner of your map and following a slope of right 3 and down 1, how many trees would you encounter?</p>
