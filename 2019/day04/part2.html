<article class="day-desc"><h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>An Elf just remembered one more important detail: the two adjacent matching digits <em>are not part of a larger group of matching digits</em>.</p>
<p>Given this additional criterion, but still ignoring the range rule, the following are now true:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>112233</code> meets these criteria because the digits never decrease and all repeated digits are exactly two digits long.</li>
<li><code>123<em>444</em></code> no longer meets the criteria (the repeated <code>44</code> is part of a larger group of <code>444</code>).</li>
<li><code>111122</code> meets the criteria (even though <code>1</code> is repeated more than twice, it still contains a double <code>22</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>How many different passwords</em> within the range given in your puzzle input meet all of the criteria?</p>
