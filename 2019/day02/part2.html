<article class="day-desc"><h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>"Good, the new computer seems to be working correctly!  <em>Keep it nearby</em> during this mission - you'll probably use it again. Real Intcode computers support many more features than your new one, but we'll let you know what they are as you need them."</p>
<p>"However, your current priority should be to complete your gravity assist around the Moon. For this mission to succeed, we should settle on some terminology for the parts you've already built."</p>
<p>Intcode programs are given as a list of integers; these values are used as the initial state for the computer's <em>memory</em>. When you run an Intcode program, make sure to start by initializing memory to the program's values. A position in memory is called an <em>address</em> (for example, the first value in memory is at "address 0").</p>
<p>Opcodes (like <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, or <code>99</code>) mark the beginning of an <em>instruction</em>.  The values used immediately after an opcode, if any, are called the instruction's <em>parameters</em>.  For example, in the instruction <code>1,2,3,4</code>, <code>1</code> is the opcode; <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, and <code>4</code> are the parameters. The instruction <code>99</code> contains only an opcode and has no parameters.</p>
<p>The address of the current instruction is called the <em>instruction pointer</em>; it starts at <code>0</code>.  After an instruction finishes, the instruction pointer increases by <em>the number of values in the instruction</em>; until you add more instructions to the computer, this is always <code>4</code> (<code>1</code> opcode + <code>3</code> parameters) for the add and multiply instructions. (The halt instruction would increase the instruction pointer by <code>1</code>, but it halts the program instead.)</p>
<p>"With terminology out of the way, we're ready to proceed. To complete the gravity assist, you need to <em>determine what pair of inputs produces the output <code>19690720</code></em>."</p>
<p>The inputs should still be provided to the program by replacing the values at addresses <code>1</code> and <code>2</code>, just like before.  In this program, the value placed in address <code>1</code> is called the <em>noun</em>, and the value placed in address <code>2</code> is called the <em>verb</em>.   Each of the two input values will be between <code>0</code> and <code>99</code>, inclusive.</p>
<p>Once the program has halted, its output is available at address <code>0</code>, also just like before. Each time you try a pair of inputs, make sure you first <em>reset the computer's memory to the values in the program</em> (your puzzle input) - in other words, don't reuse memory from a previous attempt.</p>
<p>Find the input <em>noun</em> and <em>verb</em> that cause the program to produce the output <code>19690720</code>. <em>What is <code>100 * noun + verb</code>?</em> (For example, if <code>noun=12</code> and <code>verb=2</code>, the answer would be <code>1202</code>.)</p>
